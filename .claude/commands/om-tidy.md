# /om-tidy

The acting half of the hygiene system. The SessionStart/Stop hooks and the PostToolUse write-time flags DETECT drift; this command ACTS on it. Run on demand, at wrap-up when flags are present, or when the flag list has visibly piled up.

## Hard rails (safe by construction)

- **Never delete.** Reorganization is `git mv` + splits with verbatim content moves. Zero content loss.
- **Never commit.** Git sync stays the user's call — leave the working tree for review.
- **Judgment calls get flagged, not executed.** Anything ambiguous (does this cluster share real context? is this note's status actually done?) is listed for the user instead of acted on.

## The mechanical tier (act on these)

Work through the current hygiene flags in order:

1. **Completed-not-archived** — `git mv` from `work/active/` to `work/archive/YYYY/`; clusters keep their folder (mirror the grouping); update `work/Index.md`. Same semantics as `/om-project-archive` — use it for anything with ceremony.
2. **Ungrouped clusters** — when the loose notes genuinely share context (judge, don't trust token overlap): create `work/active/<Topic>/`, `git mv` the members in.
3. **Oversized notes (25KB+)** — SPLIT, never trim: move whole sections verbatim into domain notes, event-log satellites, or an archive note; leave a one-liner index behind in the original; retarget links that pointed at the moved sections. `*Archive*` names are exempt by design. A split is complete only when the new notes are wired into the graph — search each new note's concepts (QMD when available) and link what surfaces.
4. **Index drift, orphans, broken links** — new notes must be linked from at least one note; fix wikilinks broken by any moves this pass made; update `work/Index.md` / `org/People & Context.md` / `perf/Brag Doc.md` as touched.
5. **Semantic-linking pass** — for notes created or split this pass, `qmd query` their core concepts (index name from `vault-manifest.json`) and add the links the graph is missing.

## The report tier (list, never act)

- **Open loops** — the stale follow-up flags from the hygiene scan. Chasing, closing, or parking a follow-up is the user's judgment; list them with paths + counts and move on.
- **Competency evidence freshness** — for each `perf/competencies/*.md`, count inbound links from notes modified this half (grep/QMD backlinks + mtime). Competencies with ZERO fresh evidence this half get listed — months of lead time to generate the missing evidence beats discovering thinness at review season. Report only; what counts as evidence is review judgment.
- Any judgment calls deferred from the mechanical tier.

## Report

Write `thinking/YYYY-MM-DD-tidy-report.md`: actions taken (moves, splits, links), flags cleared, judgment calls deferred, open loops listed. Keep it compact — the report is a receipt, not an essay. Delete it once its findings are resolved (thinking/ is a scratchpad by contract).

## Headless subset

`node --experimental-strip-types .claude/scripts/tidy-fix.ts [--apply]` runs the DETERMINISTIC subset from cron with no agent: archives completed work, migrates misplaced memory files (copy → regenerate index → verify → remove), and refuses every judgment class with a pointer back here. Dry-run by default.
